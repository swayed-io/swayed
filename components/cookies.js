Cookies are unique to your account, your browser, or your device, and are a user’s identification card for the User Interviews servers. They do not contain names, but contain technical information about your device and/or browser.

In addition to cookies, there are other similar technologies like web beacons (sometimes called &apos;tracking pixels&apos; or &apos;clear gifs&apos;).

We use cookies and similar technologies on our website, as almost all websites do. We also use cookies when you access some of our products and services. Cookies allow us, among other things, to store your preferences and settings, authenticate and log you in, provide you with a personalized experience, keep our websites secure, and analyze how our websites and online services are performing. Tracking pixels and other similar technologies allow us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
