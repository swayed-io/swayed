          Information for California Residents
          <br />
        </h3>
        If you are a California resident, you have a right to request certain
        information with respect to the types of information we have shared with
        third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of
        those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year,
        subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be
        sent to support@swyed.io. This same California law permits us to provide
        you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to
        choose not to have your certain information shared rather than providing
        the above described information. To that end, you may request that we do
        not disclose certain of your information to unaffiliated third parties
        for their own direct marketing purposes by contacting us by email at
        support@swayed.com. If you are a California resident under 18 years of
        age and a registered user of our Services, you may request that we
        remove content and information that you post on our Services. To obtain
        removal of such content and information, please send us an email at
        support@swyed.io with a short description of the content or information
        you would like to have removed. Please be aware that such a request does
        not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or
        information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which
        the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.

          Information for Users Outside the United States <br />
        </h3>
        The information that we collect through the Website and in connection
        with the Services is transferred to and processed in the United States
        for the purposes described in this Policy. We may also subcontract the
        processing of such information to, or otherwise share information with,
        affiliates or third parties in the United States or countries other than
        your country of residence. The data-protection laws in these countries
        may be different from, and less stringent than, those in your country of
        residence. By using our Services or accepting our Policy, you expressly
        consent to such transfer and processing. You may have the right, in
        accordance with applicable data protection laws: to request access to,
        rectification of, and/or erasure of your information; to seek
        restrictions on the processing of your information; to object to certain
        processing of your information; and to exercise a right of data
        portability. Where any processing of information is solely dependent
        upon your consent, such as marketing to you, you have the right to
        withdraw such consent at any time. Where you believe that we have not
        processed your information in accordance with the applicable data
        protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with the respective
        supervisory authority/data protection regulator. The provision of
        information by you will be for contractual, marketing, or analytical
        purposes as referred to above. If we do not have access to such
        information from you, then we will not be able to undertake the above
        types of services for you. We may withhold information where the search
        for that information would required is proportionate effort or have a
        disproportionate effect due to, for example, the cost of providing the
        information, the time it would take to retrieve the information, or how
        difficult it may be to obtain the information requested. To inquire
        about or exercise your rights in accordance with applicable law, please
        contact us at support@swayed.io.

          EEA Residents
          <br />
        </h3>
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have certain
        rights regarding our use of your Personal Information. Some of these
        rights, e.g., the right to be forgotten or the right to request that we
        transfer your Personal Information to another company, will only apply
        in certain circumstances. Generally, these rights will not be available
        if there is an outstanding agreement or ongoing business relationship
        between us, if we need that information to continue to provide the
        Services to you, if we are required by law to keep the information or if
        the information is relevant to a legal dispute. Swayed is the data
        controller of Personal Information that you provide to us if you are a
        Researcher, Participant, User, or website visitor, but not if you are a
        Researcher-Affiliated Participant, and the purposes of our processing of
        Personal Information are described in this Policy, our Terms of Service
        and/or other commercial agreement you have entered into with us. In this
        context, we process Personal Information on the following bases: (i)
        when the processing is necessary for purposes of our legitimate business
        interest in conducting our business. We take into account any risks to
        your fundamental rights and freedoms in assessing these purposes
        (including your right to privacy); (ii) when the processing is necessary
        for us to comply with our legal obligations; (iii) when you give us
        consent to process your Personal Information; and (iv) when such
        processing is necessary in order to enter into or perform a contract you
        have entered into with us, such as providing the Services. We may also
        process Personal Information on other bases permitted by the GDPR and
        applicable laws. If you are a Researcher-Affiliated Participant, we are
        a &apos;processor&apos; of your Personal Information only, and the
        purpose of our processing is to fulfill our contractual obligations with
        your respective Researcher. We have listed the rights you have over your
        Personal Information and how you can use them below. These rights are
        subject to restrictions under European data protection law and, subject
        to the exemptions in that law, may only apply to certain types of
        information or processing. We need your consent for some of the ways we
        use your Personal Information, e.g., for marketing or processing special
        categories of information about you. You can remove that consent at any
        time. You can ask us to confirm if we are processing your Personal
        Information and if we are, you can ask for access to that information
        and details about such processing. You can ask us to correct your
        Personal Information if it’s wrong. You can ask us to delete some of
        your Personal Information. You can ask us to restrict how we use your
        Personal Information. You can ask us to help you move some of your
        Personal Information to other companies. You have a right to ask that we
        provide your Personal Information in an easily readable format to
        another company. You can ask us to stop using your Personal Information,
        but only in certain cases. You have the right to complain to the
        relevant supervisory authority. You also have a right to object to us
        processing your Personal Information in certain circumstances. You can
        ask us to stop processing your Personal Information at any time. In
        certain circumstances, we may not be able to do this or may not be
        required to do this. For example, if we have an ongoing business
        relationship, if we required by law to keep it, or if it is relevant to
        a legal dispute, then we may not stop processing your Personal
        Information. You have the right to file a complaint concerning our
        processing of your Personal Information with your national data
        protection authority. If you are in the EEA, find your local DPA
        [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en]. If you are in the

        Researcher with requests related to your information. We are not a
