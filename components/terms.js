                <h3 className="text-semibold py-4">       A. Responsibility; Limitations. <br/></h3>
                          (i)     Participants and Researchers are independent third-parties and are not employees or agents of Swayed. Swayed is not responsible for, and expressly disclaims all liability for, the acts or omissions of the Participants and Researchers. We reserve the right to reject or remove any Project or Contact List (and the information contained therein) at any time for any or no reason. We do not guarantee fulfillment of any Project.
                ‍
                <h3 className="text-semibold py-4">     B. Researcher Fees; Participant Payments.‍<br/></h3>
                          (i)     If a Researcher uses Swayed as a payment intermediary for a Project, as such functionality may be made available through the Services from time to time, then the following clauses ((a) through (d)) shall apply to such Project:  
                ‍
                                (a)     Researchers, not Swayed, are solely liable for completion fees for Projects that are promised to Participants, including for Researcher mistakes arising for any reason. The maximum completion fee for any such Project is $750 unless otherwise specified by Swayed. Participant should contact Researcher to verify any promised completion fee over $750 before participating in any such Project.
                ‍
                                (b)     Swayed shall compensate each Participant that completes his or her part in such Project in the form of a gift card (a selection of which shall be made available to Participant by Swayed, which are typically to a widely-used online shopping platform) in the amount of the completion fee promised by the applicable Researcher for such Project. Swayed shall not compensate a Participant for his or her part in such Project until Researcher confirms such completion, even if such Participant contacts Swayed requesting compensation. A Participant has no right to any compensation with respect to any Project until Researcher confirms Participant’s completion of his or her part in the Project. 
                ‍
                                (c)     If a Researcher cancels a Participant after that Participant has been scheduled, Swayed may, in its sole discretion, but has no obligation to, pay a portion or all of any cancellation fee Swayed charges to the applicable Researcher to the applicable Participant. Participant has no right to any compensation for any cancellations. 
                ‍
                                (d)     Any disputes about any fees under these Terms must be submitted to us in writing within 30 days after the date such fees are incurred. We shall consider fees undisputed after 30 days. 
                ‍
                          (ii)     If Researcher does not use Swayed as a payment intermediary for a Project, all applicable Participants acknowledge and agree that Swayed has no responsibilities related to payment for services provided to such Researcher by any applicable Participants.
                ‍
                <h3 className="text-semibold py-4">    C. Acknowledgement to Receive Communications. <br/></h3>

                You may not use our Services if you are legally prohibited under the laws of the country in which you are resident or from which you access or use our Services. Our Services are not designed to comply with industry-specific regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), so you may not use our Services where your communications or User Content would be subject to such laws.

                ‍
                <h3 className="text-semibold py-4">  Confidentiality. <br/></h3>
                You agree to protect and keep confidential all information relating to Projects, including the identity of Researchers affiliated with such Projects, that you participate in or are otherwise made available to you through the Services, whether in hardcopy, electronic or oral format (&apos;Confidential Information&apos;), and shall not, except as expressly authorized by these Terms, or by Swayed or the applicable Researcher in writing, use or disclose such Confidential Information. For the avoidance of doubt, the specific terms of your participation in any Project, including any feedback or responses that you provide, shall be considered Confidential Information.
                ‍
                Notwithstanding anything contained herein, you will not be prohibited from disclosing or using information: (a) that at the time of disclosure is or becomes publicly known through no fault of yours; (b) that is or has been disclosed to you by a third party having no obligation of confidentiality to the Swayed or the applicable Researcher; (c) that is or has been independently developed by you without access to the Confidential Information; or (d) that is already in your possession at the time of disclosure. You may also disclose Confidential Information if required by law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that you, unless prohibited by law or the particular order or requirement, give reasonable notice to Swayed and the applicable Researcher to contest such order or requirement. 
                ‍
                The obligations pursuant to this Section 7 shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms and continue indefinitely.
                ‍
                In addition, Projects may be protected under the terms of a confidentiality agreement between you and the applicable Researchers, and in such case this Section 7 does not supersede or replace any terms of such confidentiality agreement.
                
                
                <h3 className="text-semibold py-4"> Taxes.<br/></h3>
                Swayed is a platform designed to connect Participants and Projects. Participants are responsible for understanding and evaluating any potential tax liability related to payments made in connection with Projects and for determining any potential income reporting pursuant to the requirements of local, state, or federal law. Swayed cannot and does not offer tax advice and is not responsible in any way for any failure to report taxable income or remit any taxes that may be due to any taxing authority. Swayed recommends that you consult with a tax advisor prior to using the Services. You are solely responsible for any taxes arising from your use of the Services, excluding Swayed’s income.

The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator).
